This project is being designed as a recommendation for improvement to Marine Corps assets. It is intended as a safety improvement to automatically turn off Aircraft Warning Lights on specific equipment during the day, so that the lights will still be fully operational at night if the equipment operator forgot to turn the lights off during the day.

The current prototype design is convoluted and overly-complex. The next iteration will reduce the project to a simpler, more robust design.

We will have more details soon.
